	Usage:
	 $NAME [options] application [application args|options]

	Modify read-only restrictions per application.

	Options:
	 -r,  --readonly PATH       - remount PATH read-only
	 -ra, --readonly-all PATH   - remount PATH read-only,
	                              including all submounts
	 -w,  --readwrite PATH      - remount PATH read-write
	 -wa, --readwrite-all PATH  - remount PATH read-write,
	                              including all submounts
	 -f,  --file FILE           - load directives from FILE;
	                              if path is relative
	                              search FILE in $CONF_DIR
	 -h,  --help                - display this help and exit

	Example:
	 setting a password when /etc is mounted read-only:
	 sudo $NAME -w /etc passwd
